prop
Nice and pretty reports,straitforward sql writing,  excellent skills on matrix ,chart and chartline handling, reach the business aim with a beatiful done. Deeply impressed by the accurate usage of Expression to get the right results, for example the expression with SUM(   , "  ")

minor concern
There are redundant shortcuts point to the same shared datasource. 
In one of dataset, "TOP1(year())...Order By",  may consider other choices like  Max(year())  ---best practice:  sql without "order by" clause may have better performance.
