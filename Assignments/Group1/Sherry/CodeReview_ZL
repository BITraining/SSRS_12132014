Sherry, your reports look great to me. (The chart showing total sales amount of each category is very nice. I hope the business people will also like it.)
And you are a genius! I just cannot figure out how did you set the action to drill through to report 3 (product details) from report 4! I have checked everywhere I know and found no setting related to this action! Please teach us during our meeting this Saturday!
